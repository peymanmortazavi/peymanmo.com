                                Peyman is a software enthusiast, an engineer if you will and a creative person. He tries to marry the two sides of his brain to feel emotional about his logical makings. He took an early interest in programming and never stopped it and now he makes things, be it music, software or a moment to make his target audience feel what they need to feel. His dream is to make an immersive theatre experience he is proud of, join Peyman in making it a reality.

                    Audience would sign up with their social accounts (OAuth) and we'd process their data and make inferences based on their data.

                        A data-driven immersive theatre experience where audience would first provide access to their
                        social media profiles via oauth exchange upon ticket purchase. Between then and the time they would
                        come to show, our simplistic machine learning algorithms and data processors would produce data for
                        the kiosk games in the show. These information varied from AI inferences to simple static data polling
                        like getting list of all posts and then presenting them to the user. The synopsis is that audience
                        members are all invited to this exclusive futuristic company who has produced many AI tools including
                        Amelia, an advanced humanoid (played by an actor). Audience can go anywhere in the stage and spark conversion
                        with actors. there are also kiosk games that can be played with other actors or audience members or simply
                        played alone. the idea is to show case the reality of the mass data sharing and ethical challenges of
                        data in the digital era.

                        This is a lightweight library written in C++ 11 that supports configuration in many forms. custom
                        inheritance logic can be defined. There are various utility methods to ease making more complex
                        config inheritance logic to be defined. This library can be compiled for variety of platforms including
                        linux, mac os, windows, ios and android. You can simply define your config manager in the C++ code and
                        reuse it in all your platforms without worrying about falling out of sync. It also comes with a Python
                        binding that's been done using Cython, it's currently available on PyPI as "garlicconfig".

                        My team and I made a simple platform where you can contribute to a charity and have it be transparent by
                        becoming a middle-man for the transactions. This way all the payments made by the charity or the non-profit
                        would become public and everyone can see where their money is being spent. This is possible by providing an
                        API to the non-profits to make purchases and hide the actual bitcoin wallet available directly.
